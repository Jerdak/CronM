Managed version of Cron for Windows
===================================

This is, by no means, meant as a replacement for Cron.  It recently became necessary to
gin up a simplistic task scheduler for Windows systems lacking the admin rights
necessary to modify the Task Scheduler.

Rather than creating a fanciful GUI version I decided to make a simplistic copy
of Cron, text file and all.

To date this project runs as an executable, not a Windows service.


Requirements:
-------------
Visual Studio 2008

Installing:
-----------
Nothing fancy here.  Copy the repo, compile, run.
